  "BREED_DESC_Affenpinscher": "Loyal, curious, and famously amusing, this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it's the Affenpinscher's apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.The Affen's apish look has been described many ways. They've been called 'monkey dogs' and 'ape terriers.' The French say diablotin moustachu ('mustached little devil'), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks. Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. 'This isn't a breed you train, 'a professional dog handler tells us, 'He's like a human. You befriend him.' The dense, harsh coat is described as 'neat but shaggy' and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs.",
  "BREED_DESC_AfghanHound": "Among the most eye-catching of all dog breeds, the Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified aristocrat of sublime beauty. Despite his regal appearance, the Afghan can exhibit an endearing streak of silliness and a profound loyalty. Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed's crowning glory isn't just for show ' it served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan's glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile hound ' standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder ' built for a long day's hunt. Their huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland's punishing terrain.  The Afghan Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, 'It's not the breed for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.'",
  "BREED_DESC_AiredaleTerrier": "His size, strength, and unflagging spirit have earned the Airedale Terrier the nickname 'The King of Terriers.'

He was a protector of the home and a herder and guard dog of cattle at the farm and in the city's markets. Today, his size is the only thing that keeps intruders at bay. The Broholmer has a heart of gold, loves to snuggle, and always wants to be near you, though his preference is to sit on you. He is an excellent dog with children and other dogs, though because he seems to underestimate his size, supervision is recommended.

Their black muzzle and whiskers earned them the nickname 'bearded dogs' in old folk songs.

The Griff's body is thickset and sturdy, and he moves with the purposeful trot of a fellow who knows what he wants.  Griffs are alert, sociable, and easily trained.

But don't mistake their easygoing ways for laziness'Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best spent in an air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather.",
  "BREED_DESC_Bullmastiff": "Fearless at work, docile at home, the Bullmastiff is a large, muscular guarder who pursued and held poachers in Merry Old England'merry, we suppose, for everyone but poachers. Bullmastiffs are the result of Bulldog and Mastiff crosses. The Bullmastiff isn't quite as large as his close cousin the Mastiff. Still, standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 100 and 130 pounds, this is still a whole lot of dog. After the first impression made by the Bullmastiff's size, it is the large, broad head that conveys the breed's essence: the dark eyes, high-set V-shaped ears, and broad, deep muzzle all combine to present the intelligence, alertness, and confidence that make the Bullmastiff a world-class protector and family companion. Coats come in fawn, red, or brindle.

The double coat is harsh and wiry on top and downy beneath. A Cairn presents as a small, shaggy, alert dog, with head, tail, and ears up, and eyes shining with intelligence. A British breed club promotes Cairns as the 'best little pal in the world.' Cairns are small enough for a lap-top snuggle and sturdy enough for a good romp on the lawn. They do best with lots of close family contact. For owners who cherish the terrier qualities of gameness, independent thinking, and true-blue loyalty, no other breed will do.",
  "BREED_DESC_CanaanDog": "One of the AKC's oldest breeds, the Canaan Dog is the national dog of Israel. This quick, medium-sized pasture dog is docile with family, aloof with strangers.

When positive methods are applied, these ancient wonder-dogs train beautifully. Agility, obedience, herding trials, and sentry duty are a few outlets for their work ethic.",
  "BREED_DESC_CaneCorso": "Smart, trainable, and of noble bearing, the assertive and confident Cane Corso is a peerless protector. The Corso's lineage goes back to ancient Roman times, and the breed's name roughly translates from the Latin as 'bodyguard dog.' At nearly 28 inches at the shoulder and often weighing more than 100 pounds, with a large head, alert expression, and muscles rippling beneath their short, stiff coat, Corsi are at a glance intimidating creatures. Their imposing appearance is their first line of defense against intruders. As one writer put it, 'An understated air of cool competence, the kind of demeanor you'd expect from a professional bodyguard, is the breed's trademark.'     Corsi are intelligent, loyal, eager to please, versatile, and intensely loyal to their humans, but are also assertive and willful, and can end up owning an unwitting owner.

  "BREED_DESC_CardiganWelshCorgi": "The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a masterpiece of the breeder's art: Every aspect of its makeup is perfectly suited to moving cattle, and yet it is so congenial and sweet-faced that it would be a cherished companion even if it never did a day's work. Long, low-set dogs with sturdy bone, short legs, and a deep chest, Cardigans are powerful workers of deceptive speed and grace. Cardis can weigh anywhere from 25 to 34 pounds, with females at the lower end of the scale. They come in several coat colors, from red to the popular blue-merle pattern. The quickest way to distinguish Cardis from their cousins, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, is to check out the hindquarters: Cardigans have tails; Pembrokes do not. Cardis are trainable, faithful, and vigilant guardians with a 'big dog' bark. Well-socialized Cardis are especially fond of kids and agreeable with other pets. These athletic, rugged herders have a love for the outdoors, and they thrive on mental stimulation and physical activity.",
  "BREED_DESC_CarolinaDog": "Carolina Dogs are generally shy and suspicious in nature, but once a dog accepts a human into its pack, those behaviors disappear toward that human. A sighthound of medium build, they have the general appearance of a jackal or wolf. Carolina dogs are descended from the canines that accompanied the Paleo-Indians who traveled from Asia to North America over the Bering land bridge. Today, they can still be found living wild near the Georgia-South Carolina border, but have also been seen as far north as Ohio and Pennsylvania and as far west as Arizona; rural areas are the common denominator. The typical Carolina dog has pointed ears, a fox-like snout and a tail that curves like a fishhook when it is raised. They look similar to Australian Dingoes but, taxonomically, they fall under canis familiaris. Hesitant with strangers, they will sound the alarm when unaware of who's at the door, but once they see their people, they are ecstatic. Carolina Dogs have an extreme pack mentality, as this was a necessity for survival in the wild.",

The word  is of Choctaw origin and is translated to mean 'sacred lake.' Catahoulas are the only breed of dog to have historically originated in the state of Louisiana.

A toy spaniel no more than 13 inches high, the Cavalier draws you in with his face: The sweet, gentle, melting expression emanating from large, round eyes is a breed hallmark. Another is the silky, richly colored coat that can be one of four distinct varieties (described in this page's History section). Cavaliers may be aristocrats, but they gladly descend from their royal high horse for a backyard frolic or a squirrel chase. They get along nicely with children and other dogs. Adaptable Cavaliers do equally well with active owners and homebodies'they can be upbeat athletes or shameless couch potatoes, depending on an owner's lifestyle.",

Ceskys are muscular, short-legged, and handsome hunters standing no taller than 13 inches at the shoulder. The fine, silky coat comes in several shades of gray, including a stunning platinum. Wavy facial hair gives Ceskys a sporty, Continental look, and the medium-long neck lends a dash of elegance to these game, unspoiled working terriers. While Ceskys are as determined and prey-driven as any other earthdog, they're mellower than a typical terrier. Wary of strangers and protective of loved ones, they're good watchdogs without being particularly yappy. They train well and want to please.

The hairless variety has smooth, soft skin and tufts of hair on the head, tail, and ankles. The coated variety, called the 'powderpuff,' is covered by a soft, silky coat. Besides the coat, there's very little difference between the powderpuff and his undressed brother. Both varieties are characterized by fine-boned elegance and graceful movement. Cresteds are as fun as they look: playful, loving, and devoted to their humans. The hairless has its advantages: there is no doggy odor, and for obvious reasons shedding isn't much of a problem.

The Chinese Shar-Pei has physical characteristics that make him a one-of-a-kind companion and guardian dog. The compact, medium-sized Chinese Shar-Pei is an amalgam of odd physical traits: a broad 'hippopotamus' muzzle; a blue-black tongue; small, sunken eyes with a scowling expression; tiny triangular ears; abundant folds of loose skin about the head, neck, and shoulders; the tapered high-set tail'all blanketed by a harsh, sandpapery coat. (A literal translation of Shar-Pei: 'sand skin.') Shar-Pei are strong, regal, independent guardians famous for intelligence and loyalty. They are suspicious of strangers and other dogs.

As housedogs, Cirnechi are mild, low-maintenance companions cherished for their loyal and gentle nature. Standing under 20 inches, the Cirneco ('cheer-NEK-o'; Cirnechi is the plural) is often described as resembling a smaller version of the Pharaoh Hound, its cousin from the island of Malta. This slender but rugged hunter's coat ranges from light to dark tan or chestnut. The large, upright ears point up the alert expression of the eyes, whose amber or ochre color smartly complements the coat.     In many ways, these lithe and leggy Sicilians are typical sighthounds: sweet-natured, independent and, of course, breathtakingly swift. It is said, though, that Cirnechi are a bit more trainable than the usual sighthound.

Amusing traits of these long-lived jesters include unique vocalizations and a knack for walking on their hind legs.",
  "BREED_DESC_CroatianSheepdog": "The Croatian Sheepdog is an agile, helpful and humble shepherd dog, self-reliant to his owner, brave and trustworthy. He is the true master of his flock, often running through the back of the herd to get to the point of intervention as soon as possible. Petar Horvat, the bishop of Djakovo, wrote in 1374 that Croats had brought a shepherd dog along on the move to their new land. He referred to the dog as Canis Pastoralis Croaticus'the Croatian Shepherd Dog. The bishop of Djakovo, Peter Bakic also wrote about the Croatian Sheepdog in his 1719 manuscript 'On the Life of the People and Raising of Stock in Djakovo and it's Surroundings in 1719'. He quoted the words written by Bishop Petar in 1374 and, providing his own description of the dog, stated that the Croatian Sheepdog had not changed since the record (from 1374 to 1719) and had not changed in appearance from that described by Bishop Petar in 1374. A systematic selection breeding program was started by the 'father of the breed' - veterinarian Prof Dr Stjepan Romic in 1935 with dogs in the territory of Djakovo. After 34 years of work, the breed was recognized by the FCI in 1969.",

Poised, proud, and wickedly smart, the Curly is a thinking person's retriever who will never quit before you do. The Curly-Coated Retriever's tight, crisp curls of either black or liver serve as waterproof and thorn-resistant all-weather gear for work in thick bramble and icy lakes. The Curly is a big, durable gun dog, but more elegant and graceful than other retrievers. Another trait that sets Curlies apart from the usual retriever is a tapered, wedge-shaped head. Like Labradors and Goldens, Curlies are affectionate and gentle, but they are a bit more independent and less needy. Playful and mischievous with loved ones, Curlies can be aloof with strangers. This wariness makes them more discerning watchdogs than other, more gregarious retrievers. These tireless dogs need lots of outdoor exercise. Bored, underemployed Curlies are a handful.",

  "BREED_DESC_DrentschePatrijshond": "This breed is pronounced da'rinse-ah puh'trice-hoon. The Drentsche Patrijshond, Drent for short, is not your typical continental pointer. For starters, the Drent has a tail and is nearly four hundred years old. The Drent was built by farmers for farmers. As a farm dog, Drents had to do it all: hunt feather and fur, keep the farm clear of vermin, cart dairy to the market and much more. The breed has maintained versatility from the beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept lively and interesting. Drents are used in all types of hunting, agility, tracking, dog sledding, and skijoring. The breed developed from pointing dogs originating in Spain (Spioenen) and arrived in The Netherlands via France in the 16th Century. In The Netherlands, these dogs were referred to as Partridge dogs. In the Province of Drenthe, these Partridge dogs were bred among themselves and not mixed with foreign breeds, as occurred elsewhere. Throughout the Drents history, the breed stood on three equally important pillars: versatile hunting dog, farmyard dog, and playmate to the children. It is fundamental to the Drent breed that he hunts all upland game and waterfowl, announces visitors to the home or farm (without showing aggression or fear), and is an excellent family companion. The Drent is used to hunt a variety of terrain and game. His adaptability makes him suitable for all manner of game in the field as well as waterfowl. Moreover, his work after the shot is exceptional, and he is a good retriever. These characteristics are innate, and the dog therefore needs little field training. Due to the dog's soft nature forceful training methods are inappropriate. The dog is expected to bark to announce visitors to the home and is often reserved towards strangers until the owner welcomes them, meaning the Drent may be shy in the beginning but never fearful. The dog is loyal and intelligent and, with proper upbringing, a pet of exceptional value on top of being a good hunting buddy.",
  "BREED_DESC_Drever": "The Drever is robust and strong rather than elegant and speedy. They have a proud carriage, well-developed muscles and agile appearance. Affectionate, playful, and sweet, the Drever gets along well with most other breeds and is great in groups. The Drever was developed in the early twentieth century in Sweden. Hunting deer was difficult due to terrain and herd locations so hunters soon realized the benefits of using this short-legged, long-bodied dog to drive the deer over long distances and rough terrain right to them. A keen and even-tempered hound, the Drever is never aggressive, nervous or shy. They are content in most living situations, but tend to be vocal when alerting or at play.",
  "BREED_DESC_DutchShepherd": "The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its herding instinct for which it was originally developed. Having an independent nature, it can be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own. Since its original duties were to keep flocks of sheep in a particular location, it is able to run all day, and that is reflected in its physique and structure. The Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring shepherd's dog living in rural areas. It was developed as an all-purpose farm dog, working originally as a farm guard, drover, and livestock dog. A well known dog fancier wrote about the Dutch Shepherd in 1910: '...bearing a great resemblance to the wolf.' Of course this is not entirely true, but it is another aspect that shows that the Dutch Shepherd still has many of the characteristics of its wild forebears. Although it is not a widely known breed, the Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports, herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog.",

His foxy head, alert eyes, and small, pointed, closely-set ears give the German Spitz his unique cheeky appearance. The Large German Spitz comes in white, black or brown. The toy and medium German Spitz come in a variety of colors including white, black, brown, orange, grey-shaded and other colors. Though easily trainable, this lively and intelligent breed can also have an independent streak. If properly trained (so as not to be too noisy) and well socialized, the German Spitz will be happy mingling with other people and dogs.",
  "BREED_DESC_GermanWirehairedPointer": "With his sporty weatherproof coat and can-do attitude, the noble German Wirehaired Pointer is a versatile, sturdy gundog who thrives on outdoor activity. Around the house, the GWP is an eager, affectionate, and amusing family companion. Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, GWPs are a bit taller and heavier than their close relative, the German Shorthaired Pointer. GWPs are balanced, well muscled, resilient, agile, and generally built to beat the bushes all day long without tiring. The harsh wire coat protects against thorny underbrush and foul weather, and the shaggy beard and eyebrows complete an intelligent, worldly expression. 'The need for running in the great outdoors is a must!' says one veteran owner. 'This breed will not be happy to be on the couch all day.' GWPs are bright and eager, but their independent, inquisitive nature might frustrate novice owners. A good fit for those looking for a loving companion who enjoys sports and togetherness.",
  "BREED_DESC_GiantSchnauzer": "The Giant Schnauzer is a larger and more powerful version of the Standard Schnauzer, and he should, as the breed standard says, 'be a bold and valiant figure of a dog.' Great intelligence and loyalty make him a stellar worker and companion.A well-bred Giant Schnauzer closely resembles the Standard Schnauzer, only bigger. As their name suggests, Giants are imposing. A male might stand as high as 27.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh 95 pounds. The muscular, substantial body is, as the breed's fanciers put it, a 'bold and valiant figure of a dog.' The double coat is either solid black or 'pepper and salt.' Familiar characteristics of the Mini, Standard, and Giant are a harsh beard and eyebrows, accentuating a keen, sagacious expression.",
  "BREED_DESC_GlenOfImaalTerrier": "Gentler, less excitable than most terriers, but still bold and spirited, the double-coated Glen of Imaal Terrier is named for one of Ireland's most remote locales. The brave but docile Glen is a strong, no-fuss dog built for hard work. Glens are scruffy, sturdy, low-slung terriers standing no more than 14 inches at the shoulder. There's nothing fancy or fussed-over about Glens. Rather, their wiry no-frills coat, broad head, and bowed front legs suggest a working farm dog from a time and place where substance was more important than style. And yet, they're also ridiculously cute. It takes a heart of stone to resist reaching down to give a Glen a scratch behind the ear and a pat on the well-muscled rump.",
  "BREED_DESC_GoldenRetriever": "The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands among America's most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a 'merry action.' The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.",

  "BREED_DESC_GrandBassetGriffonVendeen": "The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen is a French scenthound. Somewhat active and never high-strung, yet GBGVs are busy dogs who don't tire easily. First, let's deal with the name. Roughly translated, it means 'Large, low, shaggy dog of the VendÃe' and is pronounced 'Grand-Bah-SAY Gree-FOHN VON-day-uhn.' Now, let's have a look at the dog: He's a sweet-faced, long-eared fellow in a shaggy coat whose mustache, beard, and profuse eyebrows suggest the look of a worldly but amiable Frenchman. Beneath the Grand's Old World charm is a rugged, sturdily-built bruiser who is deceptively quick and light-footed. The stamina and courage of these longer-than-tall hunters is the stuff of Gallic legend.",
  "BREED_DESC_GreatDane": "The easygoing Great Dane, the mighty 'Apollo of Dogs,' is a total joy to live with, but owning a dog of such imposing size, weight, and strength is a commitment not to be entered into lightly. This breed is indeed great, but not a Dane. As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as 'harlequin.' Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed's friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit. Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily.",
  "BREED_DESC_GreatPyrenees": "The Great Pyrenees is a large, thickly coated, and immensely powerful working dog bred to deter sheep-stealing wolves and other predators on snowy mountaintops.

  "BREED_DESC_GreaterSwissMountainDog": "The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a large, immensely strong worker famous for a dense coat of striking black, red, and white markings. Dependable and faithful Swissies earned their feed as herders, drafters, and all-around pasture dogs. Greater than what?

Swissies are immensely strong, yet agile enough to move a flock across the sloping foot of a mountain. The coat is a striking tricolor, black, red, and white. The head and muzzle typically have a white marking (the 'blaze'), setting off a sweet expression. Several big mountain-dog breeds are described as majestic, but Swissies practically invented the word.",

For thousands of years these graceful hounds have been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings. Greyhounds are the essence of the dog breeder's credo 'Form follows function.' From the narrow, aerodynamic skull to the shock-absorbing pads of the feet, Greyhounds are perfectly constructed for high-speed pursuit. The lean beauty of the Greyhound 'inverted S' shape, created by the deep chest curving gently into a tightly tucked waist, has been an object of fascination for artists, poets, and kings for as long as human beings have called themselves civilized. Greyhounds are the template from which other coursing hounds have been struck.",
  "BREED_DESC_Hamiltonstovare": "The Hamiltonstovare is a versatile scent hound, bred to hunt hare and fox in Sweden. When not hunting, they can be found in the show ring, as their striking color makes them a stunning show dog. Hamiltons have been used as service dogs in America since the late 90's, where their versatility and close bond with their people shine. Hamiltonstovare are most commonly multi-purpose dogs; they are hunters, show dogs, and pets, all in one regal and versatile little package. As a hound, they follow their nose wherever it goes (and will not return for a good long while), so leashes and fences are a necessity with this breed. Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they are a lazy, low maintenance dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one breeder of Hamiltonstovare in the United States. Unfortunately, Hamiltonstovare have a rescue problem in the US as well, and some can be found in rural shelters in Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee.",
  "BREED_DESC_HanoverianScenthound": "The Hanoverian Scenthound has a calm and assured temperament, at the same time sensitive with his handler, and choosy and discerning with strangers.

In general appearance, the highly efficient Hanoverian is of medium-large size, well proportioned and powerful. Well set strongly muscled fore and hind limbs qualify him for tireless work. His broad, deep chest provides ample room for the lungs and enables long, strenuous chases.

Also typical for the breed is the red primary color of the coat, which can vary from a pale fawn color to a dark brindle, appearing almost black.",
  "BREED_DESC_Harrier": "The Harrier is a swift, prey-driven pack hound of medium size first bred in medieval England to chase the hare. Outgoing and friendly, the Harrier is much larger than the Beagle but smaller than another close relative, the English Foxhound.

Standing between 19 and 21 inches at the shoulder, Harriers have the timeless look of a working pack hound: a short, smart-looking coat; low-set, velvety ears; an irresistibly sweet face; and enough muscle and sinew to endure a long day's hunt.

  "BREED_DESC_Havanese": "Havanese, the only dog breed native to Cuba, are cheerful little dogs with a spring in their step and a gleam in their big, brown eyes. These vivacious and sociable companions are becoming especially popular with American city dwellers. Distinctive features of the Havanese include a curled-over tail and a gorgeous silky coat, which comes in a variety of colors. Some owners enjoy cording the coat, in the manner of a Puli, and others clip it short to reduce grooming time. Happily, Havenese are just as cute no matter what hairdo you give them. Their small but sturdy bodies, adaptable nature, and social skills make Havanese an ideal city dog, but they are content to be anywhere that they can command the attention of admirers young and old alike. Havanese, smart and trainable extroverts with the comic instincts of a born clown, are natural trick dogs.

The breed comes in several colors: white, red, black, brindle, sesame, and wolf grey. With early training, the Hokkaido is a very loyal and dedicated companion who wants to please his human family. They are incredibly intelligent thinkers and problem solvers, and they excel at tasks given to them. If not socialized properly, however, Hokkaido can become wary of strangers and protective of their families. The breed is extremely rare outside its native country.

Currently, Hovawarts in North America are participating in search and rescue organizations, therapy dog activities, obedience trials, agility trials, flyball and service dog training. Owning a Hovawart can be quite a challenge, and they require significant time and attention from their owners, so they are not recommended for first-time dog owners. However, for an owner who is willing to expend the effort to teach their dog appropriate behaviors in different situations, the reward is a faithful companion. The Hovawart is a family dog. It develops a strong bond to its 'pack' and must be a part of the family life; it needs to bond closely with the owner/family. If it has been well integrated into the family, it does not mind spending the occasional hour in a kennel.",

He has no issue with respectful children and other dogs. As a sporting terrier and versatile, eager-to-learn dog, he has great athleticism and inborn instincts. By the 1900s, at the end of the Meiji Era, some of these best dogs were seen in the Kobe streets, and were called the 'Kobe Terriers'. The appearance of these 'Kobe Terriers' was like a mix of the modern Smooth Fox Terriers and the Japanese Terriers. These dogs were the first terrier-type dogs to be bred in Japan. The dogs had several names like 'Oyuki Terriers' and 'Mikado Terriers', and were kept by the Japanese as well as some foreigners. Around 1916, in the Nada ward near Kobe, a dog named Kuro meaning black in Japanese was born from an out-cross breeding from English Toy Terriers and a Toy Bull Terrier both imported from the Western countries. With careful selections of the breeding pairs out of these offsprings and the Kobe Terriers a very short-haired, slim, small terrier type dog was born which are today known as the Japanese Terriers. By 1930, their work with the breed helped develop a standard and was finally recognized by the Japan Kennel Club. The Japanese Terriers did not become widespread until 1940, when they were seen in most major Japanese cities. The demand for this breed skyrocketed when these cities demanded for a small, more active dog than large watch-dogs. However, the breed faced two instances throughout its history where they faced extinction later on: first during World War II, and then around 1948 when the Western breeds became more fashionable.",
  "BREED_DESC_KaiKen": "The Kai Ken is a medium-sized dog and is one of the six native Japanese breeds.

Kai have a distinct brindle coat that comes in three colors: Black Brindle (Kuro-Tora), Brindle (Chu-Tora), and Red Brindle (Aka-Tora). Red brindle is the rarest of the coat colors. The distinct coloring and brindle pattern enabled the dog to blend in to the mountainous forests in which it hunted, camouflaging it against prey and predators in ancient times. The amount of brindle will vary from dog to dog as well as the brindle pattern. Most puppies are born completely black and their brindle will emerge as they age and will continue to change for around the first five years of their life. In the home, the Kai Ken requires basic canine care. They can be kept in an apartment setting provided they receive regular exercise in the form of leashed walks.

Bred to hunt large, aggressive game by himself, his build reflects his duties. He is a silent hunter, and only barks once the game is stopped or treed. Working with an experienced hunter, he communicates the type of animal he has located by the sound of his bark. Though he can demonstrate self-control around people, his fighting spirit surfaces around other dogs and can be difficult to handle. His spirit easily turns into aggression, as Karelian Bear Dogs love a challenge.",

In the hairless variety, the skin can be of any color. In the coated variety, all colors are accepted including black, brown, gray, pink, tan and white. These affectionate companion dogs are essentially sighthounds (think Greyhounds and Whippets) and have the same elegant contours of their racy cousins. PIOs come in a range of sizes: the smallest might stand just short of 10 inches; the largest top out at nearly 26 inches. Their distinguishing feature is, of course, hairlessness. The delicate skin can be a solid color or spotted with unpigmented areas. Coated PIOs are in the minority, and the coated and hairless varieties can occur in the same littler. Going by his general conformation, it is an elegant and slim dog, whose aspect expresses speed, strength and harmony without ever appearing coarse. Another particular feature is that the dentition in the hairless variety is nearly always incomplete, associated with the congenital alopecia. Noble and affectionate at home with those close to him, he is at the same time lively and alert. He might be wary of strangers and is a good watch dog.
