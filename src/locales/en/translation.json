  "BREED_DESC_Affenpinscher": "Loyal, curious, and famously amusing, this almost-human toy dog is fearless out of all proportion to his size. As with all great comedians, it's the Affenpinscher's apparent seriousness of purpose that makes his antics all the more amusing.The Affen's apish look has been described many ways. They've been called 'monkey dogs' and 'ape terriers.' The French say diablotin moustachu ('mustached little devil'), and Star Wars fans argue whether they look more like Wookies or Ewoks. Standing less than a foot tall, these sturdy terrier-like dogs approach life with great confidence. 'This isn't a breed you train, 'a professional dog handler tells us, 'He's like a human. You befriend him.' The dense, harsh coat is described as 'neat but shaggy' and comes in several colors; the gait is light and confident. They can be willful and domineering, but mostly Affens are loyal, affectionate, and always entertaining. Affen people say they love being owned by their little monkey dogs.",
  "BREED_DESC_AfghanHound": "Among the most eye-catching of all dog breeds, the Afghan Hound is an aloof and dignified aristocrat of sublime beauty. Despite his regal appearance, the Afghan can exhibit an endearing streak of silliness and a profound loyalty. Since ancient times, Afghan Hounds have been famous for their elegant beauty. But the thick, silky, flowing coat that is the breed's crowning glory isn't just for show ' it served as protection from the harsh climate in mountainous regions where Afghans originally earned their keep. Beneath the Afghan's glamorous exterior is a powerful, agile hound ' standing as high as 27 inches at the shoulder ' built for a long day's hunt. Their huge paw-pads acted as shock absorbers on their homeland's punishing terrain.  The Afghan Hound is a special breed for special people. A breed expert writes, 'It's not the breed for all would-be dog owners, but where the dog and owner combination is right, no animal can equal the Afghan Hound as a pet.'",

Males stand about 23 inches at the shoulder, females a little less. The dense, wiry coat is tan with black markings. Long, muscular legs give Airedales a regal lift in their bearing, and the long head'with its sporty beard and mustache, dark eyes, and neatly folded ears'conveys a keen intelligence.

The Alaskan Klee Kai is a small sized companion dog with a smooth, agile, and well-balanced gait, a body that is well proportioned with a level topline and a length slightly longer than height.  The wedge-shaped head, erect triangle shaped ears, well furred double coat in three symmetrical contrasting color varieties, and a loosely curled tail reflect its arctic heritage.",
  "BREED_DESC_AlaskanMalamute": "An immensely strong, heavy-duty worker of spitz type, the Alaskan Malamute is an affectionate, loyal, and playful but dignified dog recognizable by his well-furred plumed tail carried over the back, erect ears, and substantial bone. The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds. Everything about Mals suggests their origin as an arctic sled dog: The heavy bone, deep chest, powerful shoulders, and dense, weatherproof coat all scream, 'I work hard for a living!' But their almond-shaped brown eyes have an affectionate sparkle, suggesting Mals enjoy snuggling with their humans when the workday is done. Mals are pack animals. And in your family 'pack,' the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn't respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Mal is a joy to be with'playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids.",
  "BREED_DESC_AmericanEnglishCoonhound": "These sleek and racy, lean but muscular hounds work dusk to dawn in pursuit of the wily raccoon. The sight of the American English Coonhound tearing through the moonlit woods, all sinew and determination, bawling their lusty night music, is coon-hunter heaven. Standing as high as 26 inches at the shoulder, American English Coonhounds are deep-chested, sweet-faced athletes beloved by sportsmen for their speed and endurance. Stretched tightly across the athletic frame is a medium-length coat of various patterns, some with ticking. The head is broad with a domed skull, with soft, low-hung ears and dark-brown eyes that glow with warmth and kindness. American English Coonhounds are mellow when off duty but tenacious and stubborn in pursuit of their ring-tailed prey. Their work drive and energy, the patience it takes to train them for things other than coon hunting, and their loud, ringing bark can make the breed a bad fit as house pets for novice owners. Some passionate fans of American English Coonhounds feel that without a sporting outlet for this breed's houndy virtues, you're simply wasting a good dog.",
  "BREED_DESC_AmericanEskimoDog": "The American Eskimo Dog combines striking good looks with a quick and clever mind in a total brains-and-beauty package.

  "BREED_DESC_AmericanFoxhound": "American Foxhounds are good-natured, low-maintenance hounds who get on well with kids, dogs, even cats, but come with special considerations for prospective owners. They are closely associated with Revolutionary heroes and the rolling estates of old Virginia. American Foxhounds are sleek, rangy hunters known for their speed, endurance, and work ethic. You can tell the American Foxhound apart from their British cousin the English Foxhound by length of leg'the American's legs are longer and more finely boned'and by the American's slightly arched loin (back end). American Foxhounds have large, soft eyes with an expression described as gentle and pleading. So far, so good. But Foxhounds come with special considerations. They need lots of exercise or they can get depressed and destructive. A Foxhound's single-minded prey drive must be managed. Their loud bawling is melodious to hound lovers but can be a nuisance to neighbors, and training and housebreaking these independent souls can be a steep challenge for novice owners.",

The broad, wedge-shaped head is a hallmark of both varieties. Erect, V-shaped ears frame the round, expressive eyes that gleam with curiosity. The American Hairless moves with jaunty pep in his step that announces real terrier attitude. The hairless variety is as hypoallergenic as a dog can get.

Bred to work the icy waters and marshy banks of the Great Lakes region, these spaniels are ideally outfitted for the job: The coat is dense and waterproof, the feet are thickly padded, the toes are webbed, and the body is small enough for the dog to hop in and out of a skiff without rocking the boat. The breed's admirers describe a merry, intelligent, and versatile spaniel suited to a variety of dog sports. As hunters, they combine the working traits of spaniels and retrievers. The key to the American Water Spaniel's happiness is activity, especially alongside their adored human. An underemployed dog can be barky and destructive.",

They will protect their flock'livestock, children, smaller dogs, even the family cat'with intensity.

As a herding dog, the Australian Kelpie is intensely loyal and devoted to duty. He has a natural instinct and aptitude for working in sheep, whether it be in open fields or enclosed yards.

  "BREED_DESC_Azawakh": "Tall and elegant, the Azawakh is a West African sighthound who originates from the countries of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The Azawakh has a short, fine coat which may come in any color or color combinations: red, clear sand to fawn, brindled, parti-color (which may be predominantly white), blue, black and brown. The head may have a black mask and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no color or marking disqualifications in the breed. Befitting its heritage, the Azawakh excels as a companion, guardian and a lure courser in the United States. This ancient hunting hound is so lean and rangy that his bone structure and musculature can plainly be seen beneath his skin. The smooth S-shaped contours, deep chest, and aerodynamic head mark the Azwakh as a member of the sighthound family, canine sprinters that rely on keen vision and blazing speed to fix and course their prey. The ultrafine coat comes in several colors and patterns. The overall look of this leggy hound is one of elegance and fineness, but don't be fooled: This is a tough, durable hunter who's been chasing gazelle across the scorching sands of the Sahara for more than a thousand years.",

  "BREED_DESC_Barbet": "An archetypic water dog of France, the Barbet is a rustic breed of medium size and balanced proportions who appears in artwork as early as the 16th century. In profile, the Barbet is slightly rectangular with a substantial head and long, sweeping tail. He has a long, dense covering of curly hair and a distinctive beard. An agile athlete, the Barbet has been used primarily to locate, flush, and retrieve birds. He has a cheerful disposition and is very social and loyal. The defining characteristic of this rustic, medium-sized bird dog is the dense curly coat that covers him from the top of his large, broad head to the tip of his curving tail. The coat comes in shades of black, gray, brown, or fawn, sometimes with white markings. The breed's delightfully shaggy coat and amiable nature creates the impression of a Muppet come to life, but the Barbet is a strong, solidly-built dog bred for centuries to be a keen hunter and tireless swimmer.

He is a sound, self-assured, unafraid, biddable dog, neither shy nor aggressive. Hailing from Germany, the Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound is the Bayerischer Gebirgsschweisshund in its native German. The breed's most notable trait is its outstanding 'cold nose' tracking ability. His nose is so acute, he can distinguish between the injured game he is hunting and other animals of the same species. This somewhat lightweight, active, medium-sized breed is devoted to his owner, but can be reserved with strangers. He is not a kennel dog and prefers to be around his human family.",
  "BREED_DESC_BeardedCollie": "A boisterous and charismatic droving dog from Scotland, the shaggy-coated Bearded Collie ('Beardie' to his friends) enjoys outdoor exercise in all weather. Bred to be independent decision-makers, they can be willful but are always friendly. Standing 20 to 22 inches at the shoulder and covered head to tail in a shaggy double coat, Beardies bear a passing resemblance to another British favorite, the Old English Sheepdog. Beneath the coats, Beardies are the more lean and angular of the two. The lavish facial hair shouldn't obscure the characteristic expression: a dreamy, faraway gaze. These rambunctious comics can be a handful'but mostly, Beardies are approximately 50 pounds of heart, energy, and laughter. Well-socialized Beardies will get on nicely with other animals and kids. They bore easily, and training must be kept interesting. Outdoorsy families looking for a sturdy dog to share an uptempo lifestyle will never find a more affectionate and amusing sidekick.",
  "BREED_DESC_Beauceron": "The Beauceron is imposing and powerful, but also remarkably smart, spirited, and a versatile herder. Imagine a Border Collie's brain in a 100-pound body.

Beaucerons are muscular, rugged, and large, standing as high as 27.5 inches at the shoulder, and yet graceful and in all ways balanced. Their dark black coats feature handsome squirrel-red accents, including the red feet that give the breed its French nickname Bas-Rouge ('red stockings'). They're also seen in a black-gray-tan coat. The long head is well chiseled, and the dark brown eyes project expression breed fanciers describe as frank and confident. They're not for novice owners, who might end up being owned by their dominant dog instead of the other way around. That said, well-trained and socialized Beaucerons are levelheaded watchdogs and guardians, especially good with the young, the small, and the defenseless.",

Bedlingtons are lithe, energetic Englishmen. The crisp, curly coat; arched back; tasseled ears; scimitar-shaped tail; and fleecy, pear-shaped head are identifying features of this one-of-a-kind breed.

For an active family looking for a no-shedding, lively, and loyal companion, the search might end here.",
  "BREED_DESC_BelgianLaekenois": "Strong, agile and full of life, the Belgian Laekenois (pronounced 'Lak-in-wah') is one of four native dogs of Belgium. Although similar in body and temperament to the Malinois, Shepherd and Tervuren, the Laekenois differs in coat color, texture and length, as well as region of origin. Of the four closely related Belgian herders, the Belgian Sheepdog, Malinois, Tervuren, and Laekenois, the Laekenois is the rarest.

A sighthound of medium build, they have the general appearance of a jackal or wolf. Carolina dogs are descended from the canines that accompanied the Paleo-Indians who traveled from Asia to North America over the Bering land bridge. Today, they can still be found living wild near the Georgia-South Carolina border, but have also been seen as far north as Ohio and Pennsylvania and as far west as Arizona; rural areas are the common denominator. The typical Carolina dog has pointed ears, a fox-like snout and a tail that curves like a fishhook when it is raised. They look similar to Australian Dingoes but, taxonomically, they fall under canis familiaris. Hesitant with strangers, they will sound the alarm when unaware of who's at the door, but once they see their people, they are ecstatic. Carolina Dogs have an extreme pack mentality, as this was a necessity for survival in the wild.",

The word  is of Choctaw origin and is translated to mean 'sacred lake.' Catahoulas are the only breed of dog to have historically originated in the state of Louisiana.

Also called the Catahoula Hog Dog, they are used as stock dogs, bay dogs, tree dogs, watchdogs, guard dogs, and of course as loyal companions.",

Other names for the breed include Caucasian Ovcharka, Caucasian Sheepdog, Kawkasky Owtscharka, and Kaukasische Schaferhund.",
  "BREED_DESC_CavalierKingCharlesSpaniel": "The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel wears his connection to British history in his breed's name. Cavaliers are the best of two worlds, combining the gentle attentiveness of a toy breed with the verve and athleticism of a sporting spaniel. The Cavalier's all-around beauty, regal grace, and even temper mark him as one of dogdom's noblemen. A toy spaniel no more than 13 inches high, the Cavalier draws you in with his face: The sweet, gentle, melting expression emanating from large, round eyes is a breed hallmark. Another is the silky, richly colored coat that can be one of four distinct varieties (described in this page's History section). Cavaliers may be aristocrats, but they gladly descend from their royal high horse for a backyard frolic or a squirrel chase. They get along nicely with children and other dogs. Adaptable Cavaliers do equally well with active owners and homebodies'they can be upbeat athletes or shameless couch potatoes, depending on an owner's lifestyle.",

They are tenacious at work, but a little more laid back and tractable than the usual terrier. Ceskys are muscular, short-legged, and handsome hunters standing no taller than 13 inches at the shoulder. The fine, silky coat comes in several shades of gray, including a stunning platinum. Wavy facial hair gives Ceskys a sporty, Continental look, and the medium-long neck lends a dash of elegance to these game, unspoiled working terriers. While Ceskys are as determined and prey-driven as any other earthdog, they're mellower than a typical terrier. Wary of strangers and protective of loved ones, they're good watchdogs without being particularly yappy. They train well and want to please.

The hairless variety has smooth, soft skin and tufts of hair on the head, tail, and ankles. The coated variety, called the 'powderpuff,' is covered by a soft, silky coat. Besides the coat, there's very little difference between the powderpuff and his undressed brother. Both varieties are characterized by fine-boned elegance and graceful movement. Cresteds are as fun as they look: playful, loving, and devoted to their humans. The hairless has its advantages: there is no doggy odor, and for obvious reasons shedding isn't much of a problem.

  "BREED_DESC_ChineseSharPei": "This fascinating but challenging breed of ancient pedigree is steadfastly loyal to family, but standoffish with strangers. The Chinese Shar-Pei has physical characteristics that make him a one-of-a-kind companion and guardian dog. The compact, medium-sized Chinese Shar-Pei is an amalgam of odd physical traits: a broad 'hippopotamus' muzzle; a blue-black tongue; small, sunken eyes with a scowling expression; tiny triangular ears; abundant folds of loose skin about the head, neck, and shoulders; the tapered high-set tail'all blanketed by a harsh, sandpapery coat. (A literal translation of Shar-Pei: 'sand skin.') Shar-Pei are strong, regal, independent guardians famous for intelligence and loyalty. They are suspicious of strangers and other dogs. Shar-Pei are serene dogs, but they will meet a perceived threat with tenacity and vigor.

They are trainable workers who aim to please. Sledding, carting, obedience, agility, search-and-rescue work, and herding are a few pursuits they've mastered.

  "BREED_DESC_CirnecoDellEtna": "The sleek and sinewy Cirneco dell'Etna, the ancient coursing hound of Sicily, is an athletic hunter given to quick bursts of speed. As housedogs, Cirnechi are mild, low-maintenance companions cherished for their loyal and gentle nature. Standing under 20 inches, the Cirneco ('cheer-NEK-o'; Cirnechi is the plural) is often described as resembling a smaller version of the Pharaoh Hound, its cousin from the island of Malta. This slender but rugged hunter's coat ranges from light to dark tan or chestnut. The large, upright ears point up the alert expression of the eyes, whose amber or ochre color smartly complements the coat.     In many ways, these lithe and leggy Sicilians are typical sighthounds: sweet-natured, independent and, of course, breathtakingly swift. It is said, though, that Cirnechi are a bit more trainable than the usual sighthound.

  "BREED_DESC_CroatianSheepdog": "The Croatian Sheepdog is an agile, helpful and humble shepherd dog, self-reliant to his owner, brave and trustworthy. He is the true master of his flock, often running through the back of the herd to get to the point of intervention as soon as possible. Petar Horvat, the bishop of Djakovo, wrote in 1374 that Croats had brought a shepherd dog along on the move to their new land. He referred to the dog as Canis Pastoralis Croaticus'the Croatian Shepherd Dog. The bishop of Djakovo, Peter Bakic also wrote about the Croatian Sheepdog in his 1719 manuscript 'On the Life of the People and Raising of Stock in Djakovo and it's Surroundings in 1719'. He quoted the words written by Bishop Petar in 1374 and, providing his own description of the dog, stated that the Croatian Sheepdog had not changed since the record (from 1374 to 1719) and had not changed in appearance from that described by Bishop Petar in 1374. A systematic selection breeding program was started by the 'father of the breed' - veterinarian Prof Dr Stjepan Romic in 1935 with dogs in the territory of Djakovo. After 34 years of work, the breed was recognized by the FCI in 1969.",

Poised, proud, and wickedly smart, the Curly is a thinking person's retriever who will never quit before you do. The Curly-Coated Retriever's tight, crisp curls of either black or liver serve as waterproof and thorn-resistant all-weather gear for work in thick bramble and icy lakes. The Curly is a big, durable gun dog, but more elegant and graceful than other retrievers. Another trait that sets Curlies apart from the usual retriever is a tapered, wedge-shaped head. Like Labradors and Goldens, Curlies are affectionate and gentle, but they are a bit more independent and less needy. Playful and mischievous with loved ones, Curlies can be aloof with strangers. This wariness makes them more discerning watchdogs than other, more gregarious retrievers. These tireless dogs need lots of outdoor exercise. Bored, underemployed Curlies are a handful.",

They are not, however, recommended for first time owners.",
  "BREED_DESC_Dachshund": "The famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and bold, vivacious personality of the Dachshund have made him a superstar of the canine kingdom. Dachshunds come in two sizes and in three coat types of various colors and patterns. The word 'icon' is terribly overworked, but the Dachshund'with his unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big personality'is truly an icon of purebred dogdom. Dachshunds can be standard-sized (usually 16 to 32 pounds) or miniature (11 pounds or under), and come in one of three coat types: smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired. Dachshunds aren't built for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but otherwise these tireless hounds are game for anything.

  "BREED_DESC_DrentschePatrijshond": "This breed is pronounced da'rinse-ah puh'trice-hoon. The Drentsche Patrijshond, Drent for short, is not your typical continental pointer. For starters, the Drent has a tail and is nearly four hundred years old. The Drent was built by farmers for farmers. As a farm dog, Drents had to do it all: hunt feather and fur, keep the farm clear of vermin, cart dairy to the market and much more. The breed has maintained versatility from the beginning and are highly intelligent and adaptable. As such, training must be kept lively and interesting. Drents are used in all types of hunting, agility, tracking, dog sledding, and skijoring. The breed developed from pointing dogs originating in Spain (Spioenen) and arrived in The Netherlands via France in the 16th Century. In The Netherlands, these dogs were referred to as Partridge dogs. In the Province of Drenthe, these Partridge dogs were bred among themselves and not mixed with foreign breeds, as occurred elsewhere. Throughout the Drents history, the breed stood on three equally important pillars: versatile hunting dog, farmyard dog, and playmate to the children. It is fundamental to the Drent breed that he hunts all upland game and waterfowl, announces visitors to the home or farm (without showing aggression or fear), and is an excellent family companion. The Drent is used to hunt a variety of terrain and game. His adaptability makes him suitable for all manner of game in the field as well as waterfowl. Moreover, his work after the shot is exceptional, and he is a good retriever. These characteristics are innate, and the dog therefore needs little field training. Due to the dog's soft nature forceful training methods are inappropriate. The dog is expected to bark to announce visitors to the home and is often reserved towards strangers until the owner welcomes them, meaning the Drent may be shy in the beginning but never fearful. The dog is loyal and intelligent and, with proper upbringing, a pet of exceptional value on top of being a good hunting buddy.",
  "BREED_DESC_Drever": "The Drever is robust and strong rather than elegant and speedy. They have a proud carriage, well-developed muscles and agile appearance. Affectionate, playful, and sweet, the Drever gets along well with most other breeds and is great in groups. The Drever was developed in the early twentieth century in Sweden. Hunting deer was difficult due to terrain and herd locations so hunters soon realized the benefits of using this short-legged, long-bodied dog to drive the deer over long distances and rough terrain right to them. A keen and even-tempered hound, the Drever is never aggressive, nervous or shy. They are content in most living situations, but tend to be vocal when alerting or at play.",
  "BREED_DESC_DutchShepherd": "The Dutch Shepherd is a lively, athletic, alert and intelligent breed, and has retained its herding instinct for which it was originally developed. Having an independent nature, it can be slightly obstinate and have a mind of its own. Since its original duties were to keep flocks of sheep in a particular location, it is able to run all day, and that is reflected in its physique and structure. The Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring shepherd's dog living in rural areas. It was developed as an all-purpose farm dog, working originally as a farm guard, drover, and livestock dog. A well known dog fancier wrote about the Dutch Shepherd in 1910: '...bearing a great resemblance to the wolf.' Of course this is not entirely true, but it is another aspect that shows that the Dutch Shepherd still has many of the characteristics of its wild forebears. Although it is not a widely known breed, the Dutch Shepherd is a loyal companion and competent working dog used for obedience, dog sports, herding, tracking, search and rescue, and as a police dog.",

The softly contoured head, with its dark, melting eyes that convey an alert and dignified expression, is framed by lush, close-lying ears.

'Balance' is a key word in understanding the breed: The EC is balanced in temperament, construction, and movement. Beneath the EC's physical beauty beats the heart of a tireless, eager-to-please hunter's helper, famous the world over for his ability to flush and retrieve gamebirds.

And the chest is very deep, 'girthing' as much as 31 inches on a hound measuring 24 inches at the shoulder, ensuring plenty of lung power for a grueling day's hunt. These pack-oriented, scent-driven hounds are gentle and sociable, but rarely seen as house pets. They can be so driven by a primal instinct for pursuit that not much else, including training, matters to them. Owning these noble creatures will require an owner who enjoys an active, social lifestyle. The English Foxhound is the epitome of what serious dog breeders strive for: beauty, balance, and utility. The long legs are straight as a gatepost, and just as sturdy. The back is perfectly level. And the chest is very deep, 'girthing' as much as 31 inches on a hound measuring 24 inches at the shoulder, ensuring plenty of lung power for a grueling day's hunt.

  "BREED_DESC_EnglishSetter": "The English Setter is a medium-sized sporting dog of sweet temper and show-stopping good looks. It is one of the AKC's four British setters created to work on the distinctly different terrains of England, Ireland, and Scotland. English Setters are elegant but solid dogs of beauty and charm.

Under the showy coat is a well-balanced hunter standing about 25 inches at the shoulder. A graceful neck carries a long, oval-shaped head proudly, and dark brown eyes convey a soft expression. The merry English Setter is known as the gentleman of the dog world but is game and boisterous at play. English Setters get on well with other dogs and people.

This breed is indeed great, but not a Dane. As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. The coat comes in different colors and patterns, perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as 'harlequin.' Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice.

  "BREED_DESC_Hamiltonstovare": "The Hamiltonstovare is a versatile scent hound, bred to hunt hare and fox in Sweden. When not hunting, they can be found in the show ring, as their striking color makes them a stunning show dog. Hamiltons have been used as service dogs in America since the late 90's, where their versatility and close bond with their people shine. Hamiltonstovare are most commonly multi-purpose dogs; they are hunters, show dogs, and pets, all in one regal and versatile little package. As a hound, they follow their nose wherever it goes (and will not return for a good long while), so leashes and fences are a necessity with this breed. Unlike most scent hounds though, the Hamiltonstovare has an extremely high prey drive for both scent and sight. They can make excellent lure coursing dogs. In the home, they are a lazy, low maintenance dog who rarely sheds. Very food motivated, they can be easy to train despite their hound stubbornness, but higher competitive obedience levels are not usually an option. The only major problem with this breed is accessibility; there is only one breeder of Hamiltonstovare in the United States. Unfortunately, Hamiltonstovare have a rescue problem in the US as well, and some can be found in rural shelters in Virginia, North Carolina, West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee.",

Their small but sturdy bodies, adaptable nature, and social skills make Havanese an ideal city dog, but they are content to be anywhere that they can command the attention of admirers young and old alike.

Owning a Hovawart can be quite a challenge, and they require significant time and attention from their owners, so they are not recommended for first-time dog owners.

It develops a strong bond to its 'pack' and must be a part of the family life; it needs to bond closely with the owner/family.

The appearance of these 'Kobe Terriers' was like a mix of the modern Smooth Fox Terriers and the Japanese Terriers. These dogs were the first terrier-type dogs to be bred in Japan. The dogs had several names like 'Oyuki Terriers' and 'Mikado Terriers', and were kept by the Japanese as well as some foreigners. Around 1916, in the Nada ward near Kobe, a dog named Kuro meaning black in Japanese was born from an out-cross breeding from English Toy Terriers and a Toy Bull Terrier both imported from the Western countries. With careful selections of the breeding pairs out of these offsprings and the Kobe Terriers a very short-haired, slim, small terrier type dog was born which are today known as the Japanese Terriers.

The demand for this breed skyrocketed when these cities demanded for a small, more active dog than large watch-dogs.

Most puppies are born completely black and their brindle will emerge as they age and will continue to change for around the first five years of their life.

Norfolk Terriers are among the smallest working terriers, standing no higher than 10 inches at the shoulder. The coat is hard, wiry, and straight. They share many traits with their close cousins, Norwich Terriers. To tell them apart, look at the ears: The Norwich has erect, pointed ears; Norfolk ears are neatly folded over. Bred to work in packs, Norfolks are more gregarious than a typical terrier, but they have plenty of the old terrier pep. Few Norfolks these days earn their living hunting rodents, but a good one will fearlessly do so when given a chance. Norfolks bond closely, sometimes jealously, with their owners and make nice watchdogs. They have a reputation as a good traveler: portable, adaptable, and up for anything.",

They exhibit no extremes in physical characteristics because they must do all things well.",

As family dogs, Buhunds are smart, affectionate, and steadfastly devoted. The Buhund, a prototypical spitz, provides a good opportunity to explain the term.

With puffins now a protected species, today's Lundehund is a friendly, athletic companion. At a glance, Lundehunds seem a typical northern breed: A spitz type with triangular ears, curving tail, and a dense double coat. But a closer look reveals several unique traits. They have feet with at least six fully functioning toes and extra paw pads, an 'elastic neck' that can crane back so the head touches the spine, ears that fold shut, and flexible shoulders that allow forelegs to extend to the side, perpendicular to the body. This last anomaly produces the breed's distinctive 'rotary' gait.",
  "BREED_DESC_NorwichTerrier": "Norwich Terriers are plucky little earthdogs named for their hometown in England. The old cliche 'a big dog in a small package' was coined for breeds like the Norwich, who can be oblivious to the fact that they are just 10 inches tall. Standing no more than 10 inches at the shoulder and weighing about 12 pounds, Norwich are among the smallest working terriers. Beneath the hard, wiry coat is a stocky, substantial dog. Norwiches are toy-sized but are not satin-pillow dogs' they were originally bred as tough and fearless ratters. They are distinguished from their doggy doppelganger, the Norfolk Terrier, by their erect, pointed ears.     Happy-go-lucky, fearless, and sometimes even bossy, Norwiches are energetic enough to play fetch all day, but affectionate enough to enjoy hours of lap time with their favorite human. Short, positive training sessions work best with this clever but sometimes stubborn breed. Three words convey the overall dog: cute, cuter, and cutest.",

The Toller's trademark is a coat of stunning crimson, ranging from golden red to a dark coppery color, with white markings. Strong and agile, Tollers are medium dogs: medium in size, bone, and coat length. The almond-shaped eyes project an alert expression. Tollers are upbeat athletes who require outlets for their boundless vigor: hunting, hiking, camping, and, of course, swimming (for which they are ideally suited, down to their webbed feet).

Despite his refined appearance, the Pap is truly a 'doggy dog' blessed with a hardy constitution. Papillon fanciers describe their breed as happy, alert, and friendly.

The delicate skin can be a solid color or spotted with unpigmented areas. Coated PIOs are in the minority, and the coated and hairless varieties can occur in the same littler. Going by his general conformation, it is an elegant and slim dog, whose aspect expresses speed, strength and harmony without ever appearing coarse. Another particular feature is that the dentition in the hairless variety is nearly always incomplete, associated with the congenital alopecia. Noble and affectionate at home with those close to him, he is at the same time lively and alert. He might be wary of strangers and is a good watch dog.

After the decline of predators in the region they became property guards and companions. Today, while they are still an effective guardian, many families have found the joy of owning the gentle and loving, yet independent, Pyrenean Mastiff. The Pyrenean Mastiff should be friendly towards humans, calm, noble and very intelligent. At the same time, they are courageous and confident towards strangers. When it comes to other dogs, they are aware of their size and strength and can differentiate between a dog who is a threat and a friendly dog. They will do their job to alert when strangers or animals come around, while not known for being an incessant barker, they do bark as it is their first instinct as a livestock guardian. As a guardian breed, the Pyrenean Mastiff has a very low prey drive and, therefore, loves and protects all creatures, human and animal alike. They love children and welcome friends and family, and only feel the need to protect when there is a real threat. All that love can get a bit messy though; just like any mastiff, they do drool.",

  "BREED_HIST_Affenpinscher": "Though not classified as a terrier, the Affenpinscher was originally bred to work like one. His job was to exterminate rats and other pests in German stables of the 1600s. (The name Affenpinscher is German for 'monkey dog' or 'ape terrier.') Eventually, Affens were brought indoors to rid the kitchen of mice. In time, they became dual-purpose dogs: ratters by day, and by night devoted bed-warming companions for the lady of the house. The Affen is thought to have been an influence on the development of such later European breeds as the Brussels Griffon and the Miniature Schnauzer. Clubs devoted to the breed sprung up around France and Germany in the late 1800s, and in 1936 the American Kennel Club welcomed Affens into its ranks. The immense charm that propelled them from stable to kitchen to boudoir has made Affens a force in the show ring. In 2013, an Affen named Banana Joe delighted America by winning the Westminster Kennel Club's Best in Show. Affens have also succeeded in agility, obedience, and therapy. The grit that made them such effective ratters has never left the breed. Writer Desmond Morris reports that during a trip to Alaska he witnessed a tiny but fearless Affenpinscher chase off a grizzly bear!",
  "BREED_HIST_AfghanHound": "This is a very old breed. In fact, some authorities maintain that the Afghan Hound is the oldest breed of purebred dogs. (An ancient myth says that a brace of Afghan Hounds represented the canine species on Noah's Ark.) Because the breed predates written history by a few thousand years, and because it was developed in some of the world's most remote locales, its exact time and place of origin within the vast area that is now Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan will never be known. What we do know is that for centuries Afghans were rugged, fleet-footed hunting companions and status symbols of royals, tribal chieftains, and aristocrats in Asia's mountain kingdoms. Afghan Hounds belong to the subcategory of hound breeds known as sighthounds, dogs who rely on their panoramic vision and explosive speed to spot and pursue their prey. A fixture of Eastern culture since the dawn of civilization, the Afghan hound didn't make its entrance on the stage of Western history until the late 1800s. It was then that English officers returning from the British Empire's farthest corners introduced the breed to Europe. By the early 1900s, the Afghan was a preferred breed of the British gentry. The AKC registered its first of the breed in 1927, but not until the early '30s did the breed really catch on with U.S. breeders and owners. Among the most important dogs of those early years in America were a breeding pair imported from England by Zeppo Marx, the youngest of the wacky Marx Brothers. Since then, the Afghan's fame in America has been built on his sterling qualities as a pet and his show-stopping presence in the ring. The giant sculpture by Pablo Picasso in Chicago's Daley Plaza depicts Kabul, the artist's much-loved Afghan Hound.",
  "BREED_HIST_AiredaleTerrier": "One of Britain's key manufacturing centers before the turn of the 20th century, the Aire Valley lies in the north of England, less than a hundred miles from the Scottish border. In the mid-1800s, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, the valley's factory hands and mill workers first bred tough, devil-may-care Airedales in their own image. (It's a neat irony that the King of Terriers was developed not by royals but workingmen.) Airedales were created to be large and fearless hunters of ducks and rats, and no doubt did some poaching on the side. Fittingly for a dog from a manufacturing community, this was a 'manufactured' breed: Several existing breeds went into its makeup. These include the Otterhound and such now-extinct breeds as the English Black and Tan Terrier. A practiced eye can also spot traces of the Irish Terrier and Bedlington Terrier in the Airedale. It's quite possible that setters, retrievers, and herding dogs also played a part in the development of the breed. Airedales served in the British Armed Forces with distinction during the First World War as messengers, sentries, and guard dogs. In North America, the breed was known as a three-in-one hunting dog, equally adept on waterfowl, upland gamebirds, and furred prey. This will come as no surprise to anyone who has ever owned an Airedale, as the breed's versatility is legendary. Ratter, duck dog, big-game hunter, herder, guardian, warrior, actor, athlete, K-9 cop, and babysitter are all jobs held at various times by the mighty King of Terriers.",
  "BREED_HIST_Akita": "Akitas are Japan's entry in the ancient canine clan of spitz-type dogs bred around the world on the globe's northern latitudes. The breed as we know it was developed in the early 17th century in the Akita prefecture of northern Japan. It is said that the emperor banished a wayward nobleman to the prefecture, the northernmost province of the island of Honshu, where the nobleman was ordered to live out his days as a provincial ruler. As it happens, this exiled aristocrat was an ardent dog man and encouraged the barons under his sway to compete in the breeding of a large, versatile hunting dog. Generations of selective breeding produced the Akita, a powerful hunter with a strong work ethic and stout heart who worked in packs on such big game as wild boar, deer, and the fearsome Yezo bear. Owning Akitas was once restricted to the imperial family and their court. In more recent times, just plain folks the world over have employed their Akitas as world-class family guardians. Akitas have for centuries been the object of myth and legend and occupy a special place in Japanese culture. When a child is born, the parents will usually receive an Akita figurine signifying happiness and long life, in keeping with an old Japanese tradition. A famously loyal Akita of the 1920s named Hachiko is among Japan's most cherished symbols. Various times during the Akita's long history, the breed teetered on the brink of extinction. To ensure the Akita's survival, a Japanese national breed club was founded in 1927. Helen Keller is credited with bringing the first Akita to the United States, a gift she received while visiting Japan. Akitas caught on in America after WWII, when returning GIs brought them back from the Pacific. The breed entered the AKC Stud Book in 1972.",
  "BREED_HIST_AlaskanKleeKai": "The Alaskan Klee Kai have ancient roots descending from the numerous native dogs which have populated Alaska for thousands of years. Many of these dogs became not only loving family pets, but in the harsh environment of Alaska, were crucial for survival for the tribal groups and nomadic people. They excelled at pulling sleds, hiking, hunting, tracking, and were early warning alerts for dangers such as wild animals or enemies approaching. One of the largest groups of native dogs that make up the base of what became known as the Alaskan Husky type of dog are the Alaskan Interior Village dogs. Husky lines from Siberia, which were imported to Alaska in the early 1900s, were added to much of this hearty dog population as dog sled racing started to grow. They developed an intelligent, vigorous, and hardworking dog, with a happy nature. The Alaskan Klee Kai breed we see today was developed in Alaska from these well-bred husky dogs by Linda Spurlin and her family starting in the early 1970s. Using a strict breeding program to select the somewhat smaller dogs with the type/look she envisioned that also met her high standards for health, structure and temperament, she carefully developed a companion-sized version of the Alaska Husky with a very distinctive contrasting symmetrical facial mask and markings. Much like their ancestors, the Alaskan Klee Kai is adaptable to multiple lifestyles, traveling, hiking, sports, entertainment, therapy and service, and most importantly, a loving companion dog for all ages.",
  "BREED_HIST_AlaskanMalamute": "The Alaskan Malamute is among the oldest sled dog breeds of the Arctic. The breed name is derived from the Mahlemiut, an Inuit tribe that settled in Kotzebue Sound of northwestern Alaska a long, long time ago. The dog the Mahlemiut people developed is a sled dog, created to work in packs to haul heavy loads at low speeds over long distances. (Sled dogs, like the Siberian Husky, pull lighter loads at faster speeds. Huskies are racers; Malamutes are freighters.",
  "BREED_HIST_AmericanEnglishCoonhound": "The American English Coonhound is American by birth, English by ancestry. They're one of six AKC coonhound breeds that frontiersmen devised to specialize on trailing and treeing North America's perfect source of food, fat, and fur: the raccoon. It's said that the American English Coonhound are descended from English Foxhounds brought to America in the early 1800s. Foxhunting had been a popular pastime in Great Britain's southern colonies in America since the late 1600s. George Washington maintained an avid interest in English-style horse-and-hound foxhunts even as he commanded the army that would deprive England of its American colonies. Importations of English Foxhounds during America's formative years refreshed the gene pool used by Colonial breeders to create America's coonhound breeds. Backwoods breeders crossed foxhounds with other breeds to create the American English, once known as the English Fox and Coonhound, as it could hunt foxes by day and raccoons by night. As the breed came to specialize on nocturnal raccoon hunts, it acquired its current name. (The breed was also known for a time as the Redtick Coonhound and, simply, the English Coonhound.) Since Colonial times, the American English has been immensely popular among the tight fraternity of coon hunters. 'If I couldn't have an English hound,' a veteran cooner tells says, 'I'd give up hunting.' Today's American English is considered by some experts as the fastest of the coonhound breeds.",
  "BREED_HIST_AmericanEskimoDog": "The name American Eskimo Dog is a misnomer: The peoples referred to by the term 'Eskimos' weren't involved in the founding of the breed. The successive waves of German immigrants that reached American shores beginning in the early 1800s had a profound impact on the development of the American Midwest. German farmers who sought opportunity in America brought their Old World ways to such states as Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ohio' and the German influence can still be felt in the upper Midwest to this day. Lutheranism, the brewing industry, and the region's mania for German-style foods are cultural touchstones these immigrants transplanted to their corner of the New World. Another was a Nordic breed called the German Spitz, used as all-around farm dogs. These little white dogs were ancestors of the modern Eskie. By the latter years of the 19th century, it was becoming difficult to keep these beautiful, highly trainable dogs down on the farm. Show business was beckoning. Back when traveling circuses, vaudeville troupes, and Wild West shows crisscrossed pre-electronic America, German Spitz,  thanks to their intelligence, agility, and showy looks became mainstays of trained-dog acts. (This held true well into the 20th century. Perhaps America's most famous performing dog of the 1930s was Pierre, an Eskie tightrope walker with the Barnum & Bailey Circus.) Upon America's entry into World War I in 1917, the country was gripped by a prejudice against all things Teutonic. The breed's German name was changed to 'American Eskimo' Dog, after the name used by a Spitz breeding kennel in Ohio. Though the breed has a long and fascinating U.S. history, it was not until 1995 that the AKC registered its first American Eskimo Dog. The little white wonder dogs who performed various chores around Midwestern farms, and later charmed audiences under the circus big top, are today sought out by pet owners looking for versatile, fun-loving companions.",
  "BREED_HIST_AmericanFoxhound": "George Washington can be seen as the ultimate American. But he and other wealthy Virginia planters who came of age in pre-Revolutionary times considered themselves in most ways thoroughly British. George and Martha Washington's life at Mount Vernon was modeled on the customs of British elites who inhabited England's vast country estates. The Washingtons played English music on their English-made pianoforte, danced English dances, and entertained their guests with English chinaware and crystal. The general even had his pre-Revolutionary uniforms made by a London tailor. Another cherished British institution upheld at Mount Vernon was the traditional English foxhunt, with scores of equestrians and hounds thundering across the countryside in pursuit of the wily fox. Washington was an avid foxhunter. He kept a pack of hounds bred from British imports and kept meticulous records of his breeding program. He refined his pack with French breeding stock given to him by his friend the Marquis de Lafayette. Washington didn't invent American Foxhounds single-handedly, but he was a key player in the breed's development. The Jeffersons, the Lees, and the Custises were among other famous families of America's founding generation for whom horses and hounds were a way of life. In post-Colonial times, further refinements were made to the American Foxhound throughout the South until the breed was distinctly separate from its cousin the English Foxhound. Until the coming of the Civil War, foxhunting with hounds was the principal field sport of the American gentry. Today, the American Foxhound is the state dog of Virginia.",
  "BREED_HIST_AmericanHairlessTerrier": "The American Hairless Terrier, the only hairless breed indigenous to the United States, is a naturally occurring offshoot of the Rat Terrier. Rat Terriers have been around since the early 1800s, when they were developed in England as one of dozens of terrier breeds created to exterminate rats that carried disease and raided food supplies in town and country. Originally called 'Feists' as a testament to their feisty temperament, these proto-Rat Terriers were prodigious ratters. They were employed on farms (where one ferocious barnyard Feist was said to have dispatched 2,500 rats on a single day) and in the infamous rat pits, where spectators bet on the number of rats that their favorite terrier could kill. In the late 1800s, Feists were brought to rural America by British miners who sought a new life. It was here that the Feist was stabilized as a breed with crosses to the Smooth Fox Terrier. It is said that President Theodore Roosevelt, who adored his Feist named Skip, coined the name Rat Terrier. Fast-forward some 70 years, from Roosevelt's time to 1972. It was then, in Trout, Louisiana, that a strange thing happened: A hairless was born into a litter of midsize Rat Terriers of normally coated parents. (This is a good place to note that the hairless pups are born with a birth coat that falls out when they are several weeks old.) A couple named Edwin and Willie Scott acquired the hairless and named her Josephine. She was bred and produced Gypsy, a hairless female. Eight years later, after producing several litters of coated pups, Josephine gave birth to a pair of hairless siblings, Jemima and Snoopy. In 1983, Snoopy was bred to his sisters and sired several hairless offspring. A new breed, the American Rat Terrier, was born. The Scotts continued their breeding program, kept careful records, and founded the first club devoted to their new breed. The breed's AKC parent club, the American Hairless Terrier Club of America, was established in 2009; the breed gained full AKC recognition in 2016.",
  "BREED_HIST_AmericanLeopardHound": "American Leopard Hounds are one of the oldest of the tree dog breeds in the Americas. The exact origins of the American Leopard are unknown. Those who have researched the history of the breed maintain that dogs brought to the New World by Spanish conquistadors played a role in their evolution. Opinions vary as to what other dogs were involved in the breed's development. Some researchers suggest that the conquistadors' dogs were mixed with dogs native to Mexico and were later brought to the United States by settlers, where they continued to develop into the breed known today. Others contend that the breed's entire development took place within the southern United States from a mixture of Spanish, French, English, Irish, and Scottish hound and herding breeds. By the early 18th century, American Leopard Hounds had become established in eastern North Carolina. From there, it made its way west into Tennessee and Kentucky and, later, south into Texas and Oklahoma. During the early 20th century, the breed began to decline and was allowed to cross with other breeds, so much so that by the 1950s, few purebred examples could be found. Realizing this, three individuals, J. Richard McDuffie, Leroy E. Smith, and A.W. Carter, began to independently search for any examples of the breed. Meeting in 1960, these three men established the American Leopard Cur Breeders Association (ALCBA) to establish and promote the breed. The American Leopard Hound has been bred as an all-purpose tree dog. They are unique in the tree dog world because of their intense desire to please their master; no breed is more easily trained. They are also unsurpassed in their ability to fight and hold game at bay without getting hurt. They stay in close on the quarry, but have the unique ability to 'duck and dodge' to avoid injury. In the home, they are extremely affectionate and protective with children.",
  "BREED_HIST_AmericanStaffordshireTerrier": "Years ago in Great Britain, several dog breeds were created to excel in blood sports. They were expected to fight one another, or they were turned loose in packs against a staked bear or bull, with spectators betting on the grisly outcome. Such revolting pastimes have long since been outlawed. These sad spectacles did, however, leave us a happy legacy: Several of today's most loved breeds' the Bulldog, the Bull Terrier, and the American Staffordshire Terrier among them' got their start as fighting and baiting dogs of the 18th and 19th centuries. When it comes to the bull-type terrier breeds, all can agree that the common component in their makeup was the Bulldog. (Note that the Bulldog of 200 years ago was a vastly different, more ferocious creature than the lovable 'sourmugs' of today.) Argument begins when breed experts try to nail down which preexisting terrier breeds reside in the AmStaff's genetic background. Some suggest that such extinct breeds as the White English Terrier and Black-and-Tan Terrier were part of the genetic mix that led to the creation of the Staffordshire Terrier, forerunner of the AmStaff. Whatever the AmStaff's true genetic composition might be, we are certain that working-class Brits with an interest in blood sports combined the stocky build and punishing jaws of old-style Bulldogs with the innate courage and 'gameness' of terriers to create bull-type terrier breeds. By the mid-1800s, Staffordshire Terriers had arrived in America. U.S. breeders developed a Staffordshire Terrier that was larger than the English version. Eventually, the AKC recognized the two types as separate breeds: the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier. The well-bred AmStaff of today is a more mellow fellow than his pit-fighting ancestors and has long been a great American favorite. This is suggested by the breed's many sightings in our popular culture: In 1903, an AmStaff named Bud was along for the ride on America's first cross-country auto trip (the subject of the Ken Burns documentary 'Horatio's Drive'); Petey, in the old 'Our Gang' film comedies of the 1930s, was an AmStaff, as is Tige, the dog in the Buster Brown Shoes logo; and America's most decorated American war dog was an AmStaff named Sgt. Stubby, a K-9 of World War I who counted three U.S. presidents among his admirers.",
  "BREED_HIST_AmericanWaterSpaniel": "The development of the American breeds is a classic case of 'Yankee ingenuity' a particular genius for adapting Old World materials to solve New World problems. An obvious example would be how American settlers utilized European breeds in the creation of the 'coonhounds' who helped propel our nation's westward expansion by supplying a steady source of meat and fur. Another good example of Yankee ingenuity is the American Water Spaniel. The European immigrants who settled Wisconsin and Minnesota depended on the region's plentiful waterfowl for sustenance. Over generations they utilized various European breeds in creating a wholly new dog, the American Water Spaniel, to meet the unique challenges of hunting in and around the Great Lakes. Exactly how, when, or where the breed was created will probably remain a mystery. The Irish Water Spaniel, the Curly-Coated Retriever, and the now extinct English Water Spaniel have been mentioned in histories as possible component breeds. Their names have been lost to history, but the practical-minded frontiersmen behind the American Water Spaniel conceived the breed as an all-in-one hunting companion possessed of an excellent nose, expert at retrieving downed waterfowl (they swim like seals, say the breed's admirers) but also adept at springing such upland game birds as grouse, quail, and pheasant. The breed has even been known to do a little rabbit hunting on the side. Before you set your heart on this dog, be advised that these days the breed is scarce. The American Water Spaniel Club estimates that there are probably no more than 3,000 in existence. The American Water Spaniel entered the AKC Stud Book in 1940 and was named Wisconsin's official state dog in 1985.",
  "BREED_HIST_AnatolianShepherdDog": "Anatolia, or Asia Minor, is the peninsula that constitutes the Asian portion of Turkey. It was at this crossroads of early civilization that sheep and goat herders developed a livestock guardian known as the Coban Kopegi ('shepherd's dog'), forerunner of today's Anatolian Shepherd. The central region of Anatolia is a high plateau of endless plains and rolling hills. Summers are dry and brutally hot, and the winters are snowy, with sub-zero temperatures. In this harsh, unforgiving crucible the Anatolian Shepherd forged his longstanding reputation as the flock guardian supreme. Ancient artifacts going back to the days of the Babylonian Empire document the breed's ancestors. Assyrian bas-relief carvings housed in the British Museum, dating to 2000 b.c., depict large dogs of recognizable Anatolian Shepherd type. The earliest books of the Bible refer to shepherds whose dogs were most likely some local variation of the Anatolian. The breed's history in America begins in the years immediately preceding World War II when the Department of Agriculture imported a breeding pair from Turkey to participate in the top-secret 'Sheepdog Project.' The program's objective was to determine which breeds would be best suited for work on American sheep pastures. With the outbreak of war, the project was disbanded and the Anatolians and their offspring were dispersed. American ranchers began importing Anatolians in the postwar 1950s, but the breed really took hold in this country in the 1970s. The credit for firmly establishing the breed in America goes to Lieutenant Robert Ballard, U.S. Navy, who acquired a pair of Anatolians while stationed in Turkey. He brought them home to America and bred his first littler in 1970, providing foundation stock for U.S. breeders. This new breeding activity coincided with the passage of the Endangered Species Act. The new law required that ranchers control the population of predatory wolves without killing them. Anatolian Shepherds, who would rather intimidate predators than fight them, were perfectly suited for the job. Many Anatolian Shepherds are still working ranch dogs today, protecting everything from sheep and goats to ostriches and llamas.",
  "BREED_HIST_AppenzellerSennenhund": "As early as 1853, the Appenzell Cattle Dog was first described as a high-pitch barking, short-haired, multi-colored cattle dog of a Sptiz type, and used to guard the homestead and to herd cattle in his native region of Appenzell, Switzerland. Pushed by breed promoter, Max Siber, the Appenzeller was designated a breed of its own by the Swiss Cynological Society in 1898. Initiated by Professor Dr. Albert Heim, a committed fancier of Swiss Cattle Dogs, the Appenzeller Sennenhund Club was established in 1906 to promote and preserve the breed. Dr. Heim set up the first valid breed standard in 1914 and with that the compulsory registration of puppies in the Appenzeller Dog Stud Book. Today, the breed can be seen all over Switzerland and in other parts of Europe. Though considered rare, numbers of Appenzellers are slowly increasing in North America as well. The breeding stock is still very small, and it is only by careful and responsible breeding that it will be possible to establish and consolidate its natural and outstanding hereditary qualities.",
  "BREED_HIST_AustralianKelpie": "Following the opening of vast areas of land in the Australian States of New South Wales and Victoria, the sheep numbers increased so dramatically that some properties were over two million acres and ran over a quarter of a million sheep. In areas as extensive as these, herding (originally carried out by convicts) was impractical, wire fences were erected and sheep were left to run free. It was then necessary to have dogs to handle sheep in such large areas. A dog had to be developed to work in the conditions present in Australia. These conditions included heat, rough terrain, dust storms and vast distances. The Kelpie being able to perform the work of several men, were tireless workers in the hottest and dustiest of climates. Like so many breeds, the origin of the Kelpie is disputed. There is no doubt, however, that the origin of the breed came from dogs imported from Scotland. These dogs were black and tan, longhaired with semi-pricked ears, medium-sized and of Collie type. Others were smooth-haired with erect ears, but still of Collie type. Litters from these dogs also produced red (liverbrown) puppies.",
  "BREED_HIST_Azawakh": "The original homeland of the Azawakh, are the endless arid regions of the south Sahara and the Sahel zone. Geographically encompassing the border region of Mali and Niger, lies the center of the Azawakh Valley. Found here are most of the types of examples of the breed. Traditionally owned by the blue-clad Tuareg nomads, they are called, 'idii n' illeli' (Translated from the native tongue, this means, 'sighthound of the free people.'). The Azawakh enjoy a special appreciation from the nomads. They live under the same roof and are fully accepted members of the family. They assume the duty of protecting the encampment and flocks from invaders. They are passionate hunters and provide the family with meat, however, the diminishing of game and usage of firearms, lessens the utilization of the dogs. The preferred prey is hare, antelope, and wild boar. It is here the dog can utilize their agility and stamina. The rough and broken terrain is no hindrance. In spite of their fine-limbness, they are not prone to injury.",
  "BREED_HIST_BarbadoDaTerceira": "The medium-sized Barbado da Terceira (BDT) was brought to the Portuguese island of Terceira, one of the archipelagos making up the Azore islands, by settlers in the 1500s to herd wild cattle and to guard livestock. The Azores are autonomous islands in the mid-Atlantic. There are several hypotheses regarding the origins of the breed, but the most likely is that the Barbado comes from medium-sized long-haired herding and/or cattle dogs that exist throughout Europe. The breed may have come from a similar stock of dogs that gave rise to the similar, but morphologically distinct, Azorean Cattle Dog, given the history of settlement of the Azores islands by the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, the Belgians, the Flemish, the English, the Dutch, et. at. Under the direction of Carla Molinari, president of the Clube Português de Canicultura (CPS), the official Portuguese Kennel Club, a protocol of action for the recognition of the ¿Barbado da Terceira¿ was signed in April, 2004, by the CPC, the Direcção Regional do Desenvolvimento Agrário (Regional Direction of Agricultural Development) and the University of the Azores. The first provisional standard of the Barbado da Terceira was presented to the CPC General Assembly members in 2005. The breed was brought to the mainland of Portugal only at the end of the 20th century. The popularity of the Barbado as a pet, herder, and show dog is growing in Portugal and abroad and is facilitated by the CPC, the Associação Açoreana dos Criadores dos Cães Barbados da Ilha Terceira (The Azorean Association of Barbados Dog Breeders of Terceira Island), and the Clube Português do Barbado da Terceira (CPBT).",
  "BREED_HIST_Barbet": "The Barbet is more than a versatile gun dog. It is a joyful, smart, loving, and devoted breed. The Barbet was originally a water dog and was primarily used in France for hunting water game, as mentioned in 16th century scripts. Other references to the breed are throughout history, doing various jobs with historical lineage, always referenced with respect and admiration. After the World Wars, the Barbet was nearly extinct, but through the efforts of a very devoted few, this old breed is slowly being reborn as a dog for the future. These loving canines, although rare and in small numbers, continue to delight and amaze people around the world. Keen intellect, propensity for water and versatile abilities make it an 'all round' dog. With such an extensive historical lineage, the Barbet is a timeless and classic breed of canine.",
  "BREED_HIST_BavarianMountainScentHound": " German Bracken were the original hunting dogs, having 'the finest nose' and a strongly developed will to follow scents and trails, but only the most reliable and perseverant Bracken were put on leash to find the lost trail of hunted game. From these particular Bracken, all Liam Hounds (Leithunde) and Leashhounds (Schweisshunde) were bred, including the Bayerischer Gebirgsschweisshund (Bavarian Mountain Scent Hound). Toward the end of the Eighteenth Century and beginning of the Nineteenth, the Hanoverian Scenthound had evolved and was the breed of choice by hunters in lower elevations. After the Revolution of 1848 and the advancements in hunting and firearms, a dog was needed for 'after the shot' to track down injured game in the more mountainous regions. The heavy Hanoverian Scenthound was not suitable for the task. To fill this need of a lighter, more agile hound, in the 1870s, Baron Karg-Bebenburg, Reichenhall, crossed a Hanoverian Scenthound with a red Mountain Scenthound to achieve what became the Bavarian Mountain Scenthound. In 1912, the Club for Bavarian Mountain Scenthounds was established in Munich, Germany and is the only recognized club for the breed in that country. Today, these dogs are the quintessential hunting companion for professional hunters and gamekeepers. Though still rare, there is growing interest in this breed, with clubs in multiple countries including Great Britain and the United States, as well as Germany.",
  "BREED_HIST_BeardedCollie": "Originally known by such names as the Highland Collie and Mountain Collie, Bearded Collies for centuries earned their feed on the Scottish Highlands as rugged herding and droving dogs prized by shepherds for the ability to do a hard day's work amid Scotland's raw climate and hilly terrain. Beardies were expected to help control cattle at pasture and drive the herd to market. Origin stories vary. It was once believed that the Beardie is an ancient breed, predating the Roman conquest of Britain in the first century b.c. These days, the prevailing theory is that Beardies are descended from Central European stock, notably Polish Lowland Sheepdogs and Komondorok, brought to Scotland in the 1500s. As with most breeds utilized mostly by peasants and shepherds of the distant past, no definitive records of the Beardie's creation have come down to us. We do catch glimpses of the breed in paintings of the 1700s, a golden age of British portraiture. Such masters as Reynolds and Gainsborough included dogs recognizable as Beardies in portraits of well-heeled Scottish clients. This indicates that somewhere along the way the humble shepherd's dog became a fashionable ornament of high society. By the early 1800s the look and demeanor of the breed as we know it was set. In Victorian times they were popular on the Scottish show circuit, but the disruptions of World War I decimated the population of Beardies and other popular breeds. But you can't keep a good breed down. Britain's devoted breeders rebuilt the Beardie population in the years between the two world wars. The first litter of U.S. Beardies was born in 1967, the breed entered the AKC Stud Book 10 years later, and it was a charter member of the AKC Herding Group, formed in 1983.",
  "BREED_HIST_Beauceron": "The Beauceron, also known as the Berger de Beauce or the Bas Rouge, is a French shepherd dog whose name is derived from the vast agricultural region southwest of Paris. Since its development in the late Middle Ages, the Beauceron has played many roles: soldier, bodyguard, rescuer, competitor, companion, prankster, and peerless mover of livestock. Along the way, the breed has won hearts on both sides of the Atlantic, as much for its endearing personality as for its multifaceted working ability. Beauceron and Briard are names of two groups of French shepherd dogs identified in the 19th century. A dog show held at the 1863 Universal Exposition in Paris featured dogs recognizable as Beaucerons: upright ears, black with rust markings, and a wolflike build. Unlike the modern type, they had a narrower muzzle and a rougher coat. Leading authorities convened in 1896 to classify the French shepherd dogs. The name Beauceron was given to the shorter-coated dogs; the longer-haired one was called the Briard. In 1922, the French breed club, the Club des Amis Du Beauceron, was founded. The Beauceron is a dog of great power but of great sensitivity too. It's an upright breed who works wide of the herd or flock, unlike such herders as the Australian Shepherd, who works up close to his charges. The Beauceron approach to herding is quiet and calm; they can work into sheep without spooking them. This versatile and whip-smart breed also has a history of military and police K-9 work. They were especially useful in the trench warfare of World War I. The British War Museum houses a photo of a Beauceron leaping over a trench' a French dog used by Germans to penetrate the British line. Along the way, the Beauceron was discovered by the dog-loving French public, among them Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (1873' - 1954), known to generations of adoring readers the world over as simply Colette. She wrote that her Beauceron was 'one of those rare companions who remain silent at the right time, respect our work and our sleep, howl for our own tears, and close their eyes with a bitter discretion in the face of anything' the kiss of a lover, the tender hug of a child'¿that deprives them of our fickle human friendship.'",

So, it comes as a bit of shock to discover that Bedlingtons spent most of the 1800s doing dirty, and sometimes deadly, work. Created in the Northumberland mining shire that gave the breed its name, Bedlingtons were a workingman's dog expected to be versatile enough to be employed as coalmine ratters, varmint killers, and pit fighters. The breed acquired the nickname 'Gypsy Dog' because it was used by the wandering Romanies as a stealthy poaching partner. An observer of the breed's formative years wrote that the Bedlington was the 'smartest and quickest of our terriers.' The first dog identified as a Bedlington Terrier, named Piper, was bred in 1825. It was said that Piper was so game that he was still dispatching badgers at age 14, and nearly blind and toothless. The nail makers of Bedlington took a fancy to the breed and became known for their plucky terriers. The shire's miners and nailers wagered their salaries on epic dogfights, pitting their terriers against each other. A breed historian noted, 'Bedlingtons were never a mischief maker, but once he started fighting, it was to the death.' Happily for us, Bedlingtons turned out to be even better lovers than fighters. Thanks to their ample charms, Bedlingtons eventually rose from coalmines and nail factories to the manor house. British elites found Bedlingtons to be bighearted, lovable companions, as well as attractive ornaments to their style-conscious lifestyle. Refinement and consistency in the breed began with the formation of England's National Bedlington Terrier Club in 1877. Nine years later, the AKC registered its first Bedlington. Today's citizens of Bedlington, England, are still proud of their most famous export. Bedlington's Northern League soccer team is called the Terriers, and the town has recently installed park benches shaped like its fleecy mascot breed.",
  "BREED_HIST_BelgianLaekenois": "In September of 1891, the Belgian Shepherd Dog Club (Club du Chien de Berger Beige) was organized to investigate the characteristics of the native dogs in Belgium. They defined the consistent type of this native dog that was identical in body and temperament but differing in coat (color, texture and length).        During the early part of the twentieth century, the owners and breeders in Belgium urged the acceptance of additional varieties based on the color and regions of origin. The fawn rough haired varieties were given the name Laekenois (derived from the town of Laeken). The abilities of these dogs as intelligent and versatile workers soon gained popularity in other countries. The Laekenois' original duty, in addition to guarding and tending the flock, was to guard linen drying in the fields. He was an enthusiast worker and a quick learner that made him a desirable choice for the task at hand. He was later called on to serve as a messenger dog during World War I and II. At this time his numbers were severely decreased. Many breeders worked very hard to restore this variety, while retaining the typical Belgian Shepherd Dog intelligence, type and structure. He is admired today for these attributes. He is still able to herd and guard his flock, and protect his people and their property. His ability to adapt to new situations and to respond to his master's commands makes him an alert, intelligent, inquisitive animal. He typically is reserved with strangers.",
  "BREED_HIST_BelgianMalinois": "The Belgian Malinois (MAL-in-wah), first bred around the city of Malines in the northwestern region of Belgium, are one of four closely related breeds of Belgian herding dogs. In some countries, the Malinois is classified together with the Tervuren, Laekenois, and Belgian Shepherd (aka Groenendael) as a single breed collectively known as the Belgian Sheepdog. In America, the Malinois has been registered as a separate breed since 1959. He bears a passing resemblance to the German Shepherd Dog but has a different head, and is leggier and finer boned, than his better-known German counterpart. Mals have long been acknowledged as a peerless livestock herder in their native land. They were first bred by serious dog people who were primarily concerned with producing dogs of sterling working character and who spurned passing fads and fancies of pet owners. This emphasis on performance made the Mal the go-to dog for Belgian sheepherders and cattlemen. It was in 1911 that Mals were first brought to America. They flourished here until the outbreak of World War II put an end to the importation of European breeding stock. The breed languished in the postwar years until the early 1960s, when the Mal's admirers began the process of replenishing its American population. Mals are still prized as herders of all kinds of stock, but their versatility and high work-drive have opened careers in many other occupations and activities. They are highly sought after as police and military K-9s. They have served with such distinction that the Fayetteville, North Carolina, memorial to military dogs features a life-size bronze of a Belgian Malinois.",
  "BREED_HIST_BelgianSheepdog": "Belgium's climate and terrain are highly favorable for livestock and dairy farming, and the small but industrious country has always been self-sufficient in these commodities. Belgium has long been the world's leading exporter of milk chocolate, a key component to the national economy. It should, then, come as no surprise that old-time Belgian farmers were preoccupied with cattle herding. This preoccupation included the breeding of herding dogs. In fact, there were once eight types of shepherd dogs unique to Belgium. By the 1890s, when they were officially classified for the first time, there remained the four we know today: The Belgian Sheepdog (aka Groenendael or Chien de Berger Belge), Malinois, Tervuren and Laekenois. They were anatomically identical but varied in coat textures, colors, and length. The name Groenendael was given to the longhaired black variety, today's Belgian Sheepdog, thanks to Nicolas Rose, an important breeder of the 1890s who operated a restaurant near Brussels called the Chateau Groenendael. By the turn of the 20th century, the versatility and work drive of Belgian Sheepdogs were becoming known beyond the pastures of Belgium. Paris and New York used Belgian Sheepdogs as police dogs in this era. Customs agent employed them on border patrols, rooting out smugglers. During World War I, they distinguished themselves as messengers, ambulance dogs, and freighters of heavy gunnery. Belgian Sheepdogs reprised their role as war dogs during the second world war. The Belgian Sheepdog Club of America was formed in 1949, and since then this noble breed has done it all: show dog, athlete, police officer, soldier, service dog, searcher and rescuer, watchdog, and tireless backyard tennis-ball fetcher.",
  "BREED_HIST_BelgianTervuren": "Belgian Tervuren are one of four Belgian herding breeds so similar that once they were recognized as a single breed, the big difference being coat type: Tervs (longhaired, 'blackened' fawn or red), Belgian Sheepdogs (longhaired, black), Malinois (shorthaired), and Laekenois (wirehaired). Known in their homeland as the Chien de Berger Belge, the breed's English name derives from the village of Tervuren, the home of master breeder M.F. Corbeel. In the early years of the 20th century, Corbeel made judicious crosses between black dogs and fawn dogs to standardize the modern Terv. Before the industrial age, the farmers of Belgium had a great need for an all-around herding and guard dog. The protective instinct of these dogs provided security for farm and family, and their herding abilities assisted with guarding and moving stock. The mental development of the breed as a versatile helper and an attentive companion paralleled the physical evolution of a medium-sized, well-balanced dog of strength and stamina. Since the rise of mechanized farming, Terv owners have found new outlets for their breed's renowned work ethic and versatility, forged long ago in Belgium's pastures and barnyards. Today's Tervs are employed as military and police K-9s, search-and-rescue workers, service dogs for the disabled, actors (in the movie 'The Company of Wolves,' the wolves are played by Tervs), and champions at dog shows, on agility courses, and in obedience and herding trials.",
  "BREED_HIST_BergamascoSheepdog": "Bergamasco Sheepdogs (Italian plural: Bergamaschi) have been associated with the Alpine town of Bergamo, near Milan, for many centuries. They are among several Middle-Eastern breeds that were bartered around the Mediterranean basin in the distant past by the Phoenicians, wily seafaring traders of the pre-Roman ancient world. French authorities have theorized that the Bergamasco is descended from the Briard, an ancient Gallic herder. Patriotic Italians, however, insist that the Bergamasco came first and contributed to the genetic makeup of the Briard and other European flock-dog breeds. They make the sound argument that if the breed was originally Middle-Eastern, it must have arrived in Italy before it was established as far west as France. The powerful, balanced, and resilient Bergamasco is ideally suited to move and guard sheep on the rocky slopes of the Italian Alps. 'It would not be exaggerating to describe this breed as the shaggiest dog in the world,' says one expert. The profuse and distinctive flocks that cover the dog protect him from the bitter cold of high altitudes, and they serve as armor when doing battle with sharp-toothed, razor-clawed predators looking to feast on a stray sheep. (It should be noted that though the Bergamasco bears a passing resemblance to its Hungarian cousin, the corded Komondor, the coats are distinctly different. The Bergamasco's flocks are flat, whereas the Kom's cords are round, like rope.) The Bergamasco's numbers dwindled in Italy during the years after World War II, but more recently dog people around the world have rallied behind this serene but fearless protector. The breed's American devotees scored a triumph in 2015, when the Bergamasco Sheepdog was admitted to the AKC Stud Book.",
  "BREED_HIST_BergerPicard": "France remained an agricultural nation long after the Industrial Revolution began in other parts of Europe. And even today, livestock and dairy are integral parts of the French national character. Among the many pasture dogs developed by French shepherds over the centuries, the Berger Picard (bare ZHAY pee CARR) might be the oldest. This rustic herder was reputedly brought to northern France by the central-European Celts who invaded Gaul in prehistory. While not every authority buys into this theory, all can agree that the Picard is a breed of great antiquity, with close family ties to such French herders as the Briard and Beauceron. The breed's name is derived from its home region, Picardy. (In some countries, the Berger Picard is known as the Picardy Shepherd.) Picardy, today part of the Hauts-de-France region, has always been known as a great agricultural center and home to miles of rich pastureland. It comes as no surprise, then, that the farmers and cattlemen of the region took such pride in their indigenous sheepdog. It was exhibited in France's first dog show, in 1863, and by the turn of the century dedicated breeders were at work fixing the Picard's breed type. The 20th century's two world wars decimated the European populations of many breeds, but the ravages of war were especially hard on the Picard. Picardy, in the valley of the river Somme, was the site of ferocious battles in both wars, turning serene pastures into killing fields. The Picard nearly went extinct, but this spirited and assertive dog, though still rare, has made a comeback in recent years. The breed's visibility was boosted when a Berger Picard played the title role in the 2005 movie 'Because of Winn Dixie.' The breed received another splash of recognition in 2015, when the Berger Picard Club of America was admitted to the American Kennel Club.",
  "BREED_HIST_BerneseMountainDog": "The Bernese Mountain Dog is one of four mountain-dog breeds who were long at home in the canton of Bern, a vast agricultural region vital to the dairy production required for two of Switzerland's most profitable exports: chocolate and cheese. Even today, Bern's website tells us, 'Over 12,000 farms are spread over the canton's valleys, hills, and mountain areas.' Berners earned their keep by droving cattle, guarding farmyards from predators, and serving as gentle companions when the hard work of the day was done. Perhaps their greatest claim to working-dog fame is their ability to pull many times their own weight as drafting dogs, with their broad and muscular hindquarters generating immense strength. Despite the breed's great utility in the days before mechanized farming and ranching, by the late 1800s the Berner's numbers were dwindling and the quality of the surviving dogs left something to be desired. A painstaking effort was begun by Swiss fanciers to reverse the breed's decline. In 1907, a Swiss breed club was formed under the leadership of Professor Albert Heim, perhaps the most respected European dog man of his generation. Before long, Berners were once again a favored farm dog, and they also caught on as companions with Swiss householders. The breed's American history began in 1926, when a Kansas farmer imported a pair as all-around farm dogs. They caught on quickly, and the AKC registered its first Berner in 1937. Today, the Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America sponsors drafting and carting events that test the working ability of these majestic mountaineers.",

Growling – More Than Aggression ⚠️🎾</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Growling is your dog’s way of expressing discomfort, fear, or even playfulness.</li>\n  <li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Is the body relaxed or stiff? Growling during play differs from defensive growling.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Respect the growl—it’s better than biting. Use it as a cue to adjust or remove a trigger. 🧠</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>5. Panting – Cooling Down or Stressed Out? 💨😰</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Dogs pant to regulate temperature, but also when they're nervous or unwell.</li>\n  <li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Excessive panting while resting could signal anxiety, pain, or overheating.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep your dog hydrated and monitor changes in panting behavior closely. 🧊</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>6. Whining – A Call for Comfort or Help? 🐶❓</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Dogs whine when they want attention, are excited, or feel unsure or scared.</li>\n  <li><strong>What to look for:</strong> Timing and body language reveal whether the whining is need-based or emotional.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Offer comfort, but avoid reinforcing demanding behavior—stay calm and consistent. 🧘‍♀️</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Final Thoughts 💡</h3>\n<p>\nLearning your dog’s “language” helps build trust and prevent misunderstandings. Every bark, tail wag, or whine is a message. The more you observe, the better you’ll understand their emotional world—and the more your dog will thrive knowing they’re heard.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>🐶 Pay attention to the little things—they’re often saying the most. Your dog is always talking. Are you listening? ❤️</strong>\n</p>",

Match Food to Your Dog’s Life Stage 🐾🍼</h3><ul><li><strong>What to do:</strong> Choose food specifically formulated for your dog’s age: puppy, adult, or senior.

Pick a High-Quality Protein Source 🍗</h3><ul><li><strong>What to do:</strong> Look for dog food that lists real animal protein (like chicken, beef, or salmon) as the first ingredient.

Look for AAFCO Approval ✅</h3><ul><li><strong>What to do:</strong> Check for a statement that the food meets AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) nutritional standards.</li><li><strong>Tip:</strong> This ensures the food is complete and balanced for your dog’s life stage. 🏅</li></ul><h3>7. Account for Health Conditions 🩺</h3><ul><li><strong>What to do:</strong> If your dog has health issues—like obesity, diabetes, or food allergies—consult your vet for a prescription or specialized diet.</li><li><strong>Tip:</strong> Look for added nutrients like glucosamine (for joints) or omega-3s (for skin). 🐾</li></ul><h3>8. Dry vs. Wet Food – What’s Best? 🥩🥣</h3><ul><li><strong>What to do:</strong> Dry food is convenient and helps clean teeth; wet food adds hydration and is often more palatable.</li><li><strong>Tip:</strong> A mix of both can offer variety and balance.
